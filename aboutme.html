<p> Hello My name is Seblewerk Enyew.</p> 
<p> My birthday is on Feburary 23 2001.</p>
<p> A little about myself is that I am new to coding.</p>
<p> I am going to be a Junior at Thomas Jefferson Highschool.</p> 
<p> I enjoy playing sports such as soccer and basketball.</p> 
<p> Today 7/17/2017: We learned about Robots. I love the idea of Robots. 
They look pretty interesting and I think we should spend more time on them. 
I just love to see them in action and trying to solve the problems. I think 
I might get a little bit nervous when I face challanging problems. When we 
were working in our groups something that was challenging was that it was really 
hard to out the wires in the right place so we didnt have to burn our the LED. </p>
