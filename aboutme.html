<p1> 7/17/2017: We learned about Robots. I love the idea of Robots. They look pretty interesting and I think we should spend more time on them. I just love to see them in action and trying to solve the problems. I think, I might get a little bit nervous when I face challanging problems. When we were working in our groups something that was challenging was that it was really hard to out the wires in the right place so we didnt have to burn our the LED.
